# Dashboard Summary
Larger map display, row and bar chart addition, and map encapsulating selection options are some improvements to [Dashboard I](https://github.com/mikelotis/Edmonton-Bylaw-Infractions-I). Data used in Dashboard II is similar to Dashboard I. Dashboard II's code is more efficient, maintainable, and scalable. 
Inspiration for the Project: KaitR block and drive to complete crucial TODOs
Frameworks used include: [Leaflet.SlideMenu](https://github.com/unbam/Leaflet.SlideMenu), [FontAwesome](https://github.com/unbam/Leaflet.SlideMenu), and [same frameworks as Dashboard I](https://github.com/mikelotis/Edmonton-Bylaw-Infractions-I/blob/master/README.md#dashboard-summary)
Built using: Google Chrome
Desktop and mobile Dashboard: [****BYLAW INFRACTIONS DASHBOARD II (CLICK ME!)****](https://mikelotis.github.io/Edmonton-Bylaw-Infractions-II/)
Note: Failures of Dashboard I made Dashboard II a reality 
# Lessons Learned from Dashboard I
* Wrote code in the constraints of dc addons eg and geo viz inspiration
* Lack of taking the time to understand the arising issues
* Intimidated by the KaitR code and didnt look at the code to get bits that were needed
* Abruptly used possible examples without deep thought
# Lessons Learned from Dashboard II
* Learning basics facilitates desired advances
* Taking advantage of the DOM model
# Improvements
# TODOs
