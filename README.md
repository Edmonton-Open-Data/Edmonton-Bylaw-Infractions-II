# Dashboard Summary
Larger map display, row and bar chart addition, and map encapsulating selection options are some improvements to [Dashboard I](https://github.com/mikelotis/Edmonton-Bylaw-Infractions-I). Data used in Dashboard II is similar to Dashboard I. Dashboard II's code is more efficient, maintainable, and scalable.
Inspiration for the Project: [Mean Daily Temperature Extremes](http://bl.ocks.org/KatiRG/cccd23dd7a830da0de5c) and drive to complete crucial TODOs
Frameworks used include: [Leaflet.SlideMenu](https://github.com/unbam/Leaflet.SlideMenu), [FontAwesome](https://github.com/unbam/Leaflet.SlideMenu), and [same frameworks as Dashboard I](https://github.com/mikelotis/Edmonton-Bylaw-Infractions-I/blob/master/README.md#dashboard-summary)
Built using: Google Chrome
Desktop and mobile Dashboard: [****BYLAW INFRACTIONS DASHBOARD II (CLICK ME!)****](https://mikelotis.github.io/Edmonton-Bylaw-Infractions-II/)
***Note: *** 
# Lessons Learned from Dashboard I
* Wrote code in the constraints of [Le choropleth](http://intellipharm.github.io/dc-addons/examples/leaflet-marker.html) and [Interactive Data Visualization](http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2016/08/interactive-data-visualization-geospatial-d3-dc-leaflet-python/)
* Lack of taking time to understand arising issues
* Intimidated by [Mean Daily Temperature Extremes](http://bl.ocks.org/KatiRG/cccd23dd7a830da0de5c) code and didn't think of extracting required code
* Abruptly used potential researched examples without deep thought
# Lessons Learned from Dashboard II
* Learning [responsive basics](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/building-responsive-data-visualizations-d3js-video) enabled desired improvements
* Understood arising issues using global variables and Document Object Model
* Diving deeper into [d3.js](http://devdocs.io/d3~3/), [dc.js](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/), [leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/reference-0.7.7.html), [dc-addons](https://github.com/Intellipharm/dc-addons#dc-addons),and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) docs aided in making the code efficient
* Mathematics was a crucial tool in achieving Dashboard II's responsiveness
* Failures of Dashboard I made Dashboard II a reality
# Improvements
* Altered layout to enable smooth viewing on both mobile and desktop
* Made the dashboard responsive using [viewbox sizing](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/docs/html/dc.baseMixin.html#useViewBoxResizing__anchor)
* Changed the default map base layer code core of dc addons
* Removed heatmap to speed up yearly and monthly analysis
* [Checked TODO's](https://github.com/mikelotis/Edmonton-Bylaw-Infractions-I/blob/master/README.md#todos) for Dashboard I
